"""Class Notes"""

int = Interger 
    Whole numbers
    You use "_" instead of "," for 1_000_000
float = Floating-point
    Decimal numbers that are as percise as we need them to be but not for banking and such
str = Stings of characters
    This is fr characters, both letter based and special like {!@#$()} 
    They need to start and end with "Quotes"
        If you need "Quotes" withen your string "this is a bit complicated" you need to add back slash print("\"this is a bit complicated\"") 
            (the backslashes are leading)
    Any number can be a sting if inside "Quotes"
    Two string vales with the + between will bond them together
        "abc" + "def" = 'abcdef'
    len = length 
        tells you the length of a string
        len("pizza") = 5 
        you can also pick out a character from a string by adding a number to the end
            "pizza"[1] = 'i'
        if added to "len" then you can do the same thing
            "pizza"[len("Pizza") - 4] = 'i'
                starting with "pizza" will print the character, starting without the string will print a number
    The first itme in a sequence will index at '0'
    "Integers and floating-point values are not sequences, they are singular numerical values. Thus, you cannot subscript them like a str"
bool = Booleans
    These are True False indicators and/or deciders
        100 < 200 = False
        300 > 258 = True
not > and > or 

\"  == Double quote (")
\'	== Single quote (')
\t	== Tab
\n	== New Line
\\	== Backslash (\)
\Uxxxxxxxx	== 32-bit unicode character

return is a print and an exit

and = False
or = True
